Changes in v1.3:
- Complete re-design of the Klaverjas engine. A round is now executed as a
  series of actions. Each action is defined in a seperate class.
- Re-implementation of the Rotterdam rules. Undertrumping is now impossible.
- Added the notion of an engine-side Trick and a shared Trick. The shared
  Trick interfaces the engine Trick for all players, providing them only the
  information that they need.
