KlaverjasAIChallenge is a game engine for the dutch card game Klaverjas that
lets AI's compete against each other in games of Klaverjas.

To write an AI for the klaverjasaichallenge, the following information might
be useful to you:
- Source code can be checked out using Mercurial:
  hg clone https://klaverjasaichallenge.googlecode.com/hg/ klaverjasaichallenge
- In package src/org/klaverjasaichallange/ai there is an example of a very
  simple AI to get you started.
- The AI has to implement the KlaverJasAI interface.
- The AI may not communicate with his teammate.
- The AI may not cheat, but if he does the application will crash with a
  RuntimeException.
- The shared package provides useful (helper) classes for your AI.
- Currently only the Rotterdam variation of klaverjas is implemented.
