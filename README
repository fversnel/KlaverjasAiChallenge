To write an AI for the klaverjasaichallenge, the following information might
be useful to you:

- You can check out the source code of the app using svn: svn checkout
  http://klaverjasaichallenge.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
  klaverjasaichallenge-read-only
- In package src/org/klaverjasaichallange/ai there is an example of a very
  simple AI to get you started.
- The AI has to implement the KlaverJasAI interface.
- The AI may not communicate with his teammate.
- The AI may not cheat, but if he does the application will crash with a
  CheatException.
- The shared package provides useful (helper) classes for your AI.
- Currently only the Rotterdam variation of klaverjas is implemented.

Glossary:
Trump = the suit to rule all others.
Trick = 4 cards, from each player 1 card.
Round = 8 tricks.
Game = 16 rounds.
Hand = the cards that are in the players hands (each player starts with 8
cards).
Ruleset = the ruleset that is used. Currently only the Rotterdam variation is
used, so this class is now useless. In the future other rulesets (like the
Amsterdam variation) might be added.
Team = 2 cooperative players.
CheatException = Will occur when an AI cheats. For example, by playing a card
that's not allowed by the ruleset, or by playing a card that is not in his
hand.
Order = A wrapper on int, identifing (for example) the rank of a card. A higher
order means a better rank.
