Changes in v1.4:
- Sadly, 1.4 is not backwards compatible with 1.3.
- Trick is now an interface instead of a class. The engine contains the only
  known implementation which is package local, and thus cannot be used by the
  AI's. 
- Introduction of the Hand class to AI's. Previously this was a List of cards.
  The Hand class is more sophisticated; providing the AI with several helper
  methods for looking up the cards in his hand.
- All shared classes can now be extended, their properties are now protected
  instead of private.
- Several changes on the interfaces of Card and Trick.

Changes in v1.3:
- Complete re-design of the Klaverjas engine. A round is now executed as a
  series of actions. Each action is defined in a seperate class.
- Re-implementation of the Rotterdam rule set. Undertrumping is now impossible.
- Added the notion of an engine-side Trick and a shared Trick. The shared
  Trick interfaces the engine Trick for all players, providing them only with
  the information that they need.
