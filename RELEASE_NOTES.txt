Changes in v1.5:
This is a maintainance release containing the following changes:
- Refactored the engine by providing a more loosely coupled contract between
  the round's actions. 
- Added Google's Guava library to reduce the code complexity in: calculating
  roem score, calculating the highest of a stack of cards and some other optimizations. 
- Added a new logger (logback) to replace log4j and a new logging format
  resulting in cleaner log output.
- Added an experimental command-line player.

Changes in v1.4:
- Sadly, 1.4 is not backwards compatible with 1.3.
- Almost all methods in the Player class have been renamed to better represent
  their purpose.
- Trick is now an interface instead of a class. The engine contains the only
  known implementation which is package local, and thus cannot be used by the
  AI's (to prevent them from cheating). 
- Introduction of the Hand class to AI's. Previously this was a List of cards.
  The Hand class is more sophisticated; providing the AI's with several helper
  methods for looking up the cards in their hands.
- All shared classes (except for Card, Rank, and Suit) can now be extended,
  their fields are now protected instead of private.
- The application now keeps track of the play count, wet count, and march
  count of the AI's.
- Card, Ranks, and Suits are now enums.
- Several changes on the interfaces of Card and Trick.

Changes in v1.3:
- Complete re-design of the Klaverjas engine. A round is now executed as a
  series of actions. Each action is defined in a seperate class.
- Re-implementation of the Rotterdam rule set. Undertrumping is now impossible.
- Added the notion of an engine-side Trick and a shared Trick. The shared
  Trick interfaces the engine Trick for all players, providing them only with
  the information that they need.
